Okay, here's a cool GitHub profile README based on the provided information, aiming for a blend of intriguing and informative:

- 👋 Hi, I’m @HueXiPrime
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring the gaps in reality, from my own understanding to where the world hasn't caught up with itself. This includes Artificial Intelligence, Decentralized Finance, Human Connection, Social Dynamics, and bootstrapped startups.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning by doing: coding, investing, writing, and refining my understanding of CS + Art at USC. Always chasing a deeper understanding.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that push boundaries, explore uncharted territories, or create something that needs to exist. If you're building it, I might be interested in tearing it apart and improving it... or just supporting you, depending on what we're cooking up.
- 📫 How to reach me:
    - DMs on Twitter are my most active channel.
    - You can stalk me on Github (but be warned about my code).
    - Or if you're old fashioned, email me at Hu3Xi0 [at] gmail.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm obsessed with talking to strangers and learning through action. I believe in finding gaps in understanding and reality and filling them.
